# 📘 Binary Number System

The **Binary Number System** is the foundation of all modern computing. It uses only two digits: `0` and `1`, representing the **OFF** and **ON** states in digital electronics.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

* **Base:** `2` (uses only `0` and `1`)
* **Place Values:** Powers of 2 from right to left
  e.g., `1101` = `1×2³ + 1×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 13`

## 🔄 Common Conversions

### ✅ Decimal ➝ Binary

Divide by 2, write remainders in reverse.
**Example:**
`13 → 1101`

### ✅ Binary ➝ Decimal

Multiply each bit by powers of 2 and sum.
**Example:**
`1011 → 1×2³ + 0×2² + 1×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 11`

## 🔚 Conclusion

The **binary number system** is a core concept behind digital systems, programming, and data structures. 

Understanding binary enables you to grasp **bit manipulation**, optimize algorithms, and work confidently with **low-level data operations**. 

Also, knowing about octal, decimal, and hexadecimal systems enhances your number sense in various computing domains.
