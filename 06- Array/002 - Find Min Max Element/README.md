# C++ Program: Find Minimum and Maximum Element  

## What does this program do?  
This program finds the **minimum** and **maximum** elements in an integer array using a loop.

## How does it work?  
1. It initializes `minEle` with the highest possible integer (`INT_MAX`).  
2. It initializes `maxEle` with the lowest possible integer (`INT_MIN`).  
3. It iterates through the array and updates `minEle` and `maxEle` accordingly.  
4. Finally, it prints the smallest and largest numbers in the array.  

## What is the input and output of this program?  
### Input:  
The program uses a predefined array:  
```cpp
int arr[] = {20, 10, 30, 50, 40};
```

### Output:  
```
Minimum Number is 10  
Maximum Number is 50  
```
